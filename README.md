# Semantic-Segmentation-and-Knowledge-Distillation
This project focuses on implementing semantic segmentation and knowledge distillation techniques using PyTorch. A lightweight student model is designed and trained to distill knowledge from a pretrained FCN-ResNet50 on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. The model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy (mIoU).
